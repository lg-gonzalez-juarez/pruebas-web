Development of control algorithms for low and high voltage electrical systems. Design and start up of Power Hardware in the Loop (PHIL) systems dedicated to the validation of real-time control systems.

Senior technology consultant at ALTRAN, design and implementation of control algorithms for wind, photovoltaic and compensation devices in real distributed generation systems. Design of automated validation tests of control algorithms focused on continuous integration systems.

In the CIRCE research center she has worked in the area of ​​electrical protection systems and approval of electric power relays using PHIL. During the development of her PhD at the Carlos III University of Madrid, she has participated in the development of smart grid management systems within the CERES research group.

Experience in the oil sector within PEMEX (Mexico), in the design of control architectures for electrical systems, including design of electrical installations, motor control and electrical substations. Experience in the field of power electronics with embedded systems (FPGA and PHIL) applied to power quality and controllable distributed generation source systems.

Specialization in the fields of control system design incorporating real-time digital simulation technologies (RTDS), experimental implementation of control systems applied to distributed generation sources and FACTS devices using the platforms: LabVIEW, xPC Target (MATLAB/Simulink RT), dSPACE and OPAL-RT.
